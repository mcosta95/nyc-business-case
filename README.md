To enable Large Language Model (LLM) functionality (e.g., for generating `violation_category` and for the extra analysis), you'll need to set up your API key for Mistral.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory.
2. Add your **Mistral API key** to the file as follows:

   ```env
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=<API_KEY_TOKEN>
   ```

Note: For privaty reasons, the API key is not included in this repository.
